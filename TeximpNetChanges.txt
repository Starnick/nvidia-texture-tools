TeximpNet Changes:

(I don't plan on PRing these changes back to the original project)

1. CmakeLists.txt (line 39)

What:

Set the other libraries to static so we can have a single nvtt DLL

Code:

IF(NVTT_SHARED)
	SET(NVCORE_SHARED FALSE)
	SET(NVMATH_SHARED FALSE)
	SET(NVIMAGE_SHARED FALSE)
ENDIF(NVTT_SHARED)


2. configure script

What:

Made library default to shared, -DNVTT_SHARED=1 (originally set to 0)


3. src/CmakeLists.txt (line 124)

What:

Disable OpenMP support

Code:

#INCLUDE(FindOpenMP)
#IF(OPENMP_FOUND)
#	SET(HAVE_OPENMP ${OPENMP_FOUND} CACHE BOOL "Set to TRUE if OpenMP is found, FALSE otherwise")
#	MESSAGE(STATUS "Looking for OpenMP - found")
#	SET(CMAKE_C_FLAGS "${CMAKE_C_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_C_FLAGS}")
#	SET(CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS "${CMAKE_CXX_FLAGS} ${OpenMP_CXX_FLAGS}")
#ELSE(OPENMP_FOUND)
#	MESSAGE(STATUS "Looking for OpenMP - not found")
#ENDIF(OPENMP_FOUND)


4. project/vc2017-teximp

What:

Changed all VC projects to output Multi-Threaded (/MT) rather than /MD which means the VC runtime library will be statically linked. So
we won't have to have a runtime dependency. We copied the original vc2017 folder so it's isolated from the original project files.


5. Added azure-pipelines.yml file for CI builds
